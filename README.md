# sentiment-based-product-recommendation-system
Ebuss has captured a huge market share in many fields, and it sells the products in various categories such as household essentials, books, personal care products, medicines, cosmetic items, beauty products, electrical appliances, kitchen and dining products and health care products.

With the advancement in technology, it is imperative for Ebuss to grow quickly in the e-commerce market to become a major leader in the market because it has to compete with the likes of Amazon, Flipkart, etc., which are already market leaders.

The objective is to build a model that will improve the recommendations given to the users given their past reviews and ratings. In order to do this, We have planned to build a sentiment-based product recommendation system
